## My 40 Recommended YouTube Channels

Each channel has a quick about sentence or two, a recommended video, and a link to the channel. We are not affilianted with or sponsored by any of these, but they make great learning material and we can't recommend these enough!

This large list of channels engulfs anything useful, educational, or entertaining to nerds (of math, science, or history), engineers (of hardware or software), or curious people and would recommend binging.

There are no bad channels listed here. These are the top of the top of the top. Enjoy!

### Web Programming

[The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/@NetNinja)

- About: Shaun is absolutely at the top of the list. Pick a topic and click a playlist and learn. He's super approachable and great at teaching. The Net Ninja is the one single channel I recommend to anyone trying to start programming, at any age. His videos are also useful even if you've been programming for decades. He also has absolutely tons of content. Just about anything you want to learn about web dev, he's got you covered. When someone says they want to learn to make websites, I point them in three places: the W3schools website, the SoloLearn app, and the Net Ninja YouTube channel
- Recommended ~~Video~~ Playlist: [Async javascript playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcQyJ-gxke0&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jx2TTZk3IGWKSbtugYdrlu&ab_channel=NetNinja)

[Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified)

- About: WDS makes amazing videos all about the web. He's got plenty of videos and they're very approachable and educational. Highly, highly, highly recommend.
- Recommended Video: [Javascript array methods](https://youtu.be/mSBnJvHtgD0?si=V9CNe9YYkfSwfIHk)

[Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell)

- About: Kevin has absolutely amazing educational videos on just about everything css. He "is" the css guy, and uploads frequently and makes great videos. The video I recommended is a little more complex, but he has simpler videos too on creating different effects, new css features, dive into css units, containers, positions, parallax, and more.
- Recommended Video: [3d tilting card effect](https://youtu.be/Z-3tPXf9a7M?si=m2Nk4jrdMZhXeh8s)

[Juxtopposed](https://www.youtube.com/@juxtopposed)

- About: Juxtopposed makes amazing, well-produced, and short videos on web design / css / UI design. Juxtopposed is truly talented and fun to watch. It's nearly a perfect channel, but it isn't as educational as say WDS or Kevin above.
- Recommended Video: [Steam UI redesigned](https://youtu.be/cDY2p1CTkPo?si=xQB3e78G9voQKMod)

[Hyperplexed](https://www.youtube.com/@Hyperplexed)

- About: Another absolutely killer ui/ux/design channel. I feel like Hyperplexed is the twin to Juxtopposed. I personally like the redesign videos. There's an Amazon and Google redesign video that's great too. Fun and entertaining even if you're not a web dev, but definitely more for web devs.
- Recommended Video: [I Redesigned Popular Websites - Costco & Domino's](https://youtu.be/m0S6Evbr07k?si=fLDNaRfMVys48dFj)

[DesignCourse](https://www.youtube.com/@DesignCourse)

- About: Gary has amazing videos on web and design. His videos are all about design and making good looking and functional websites. If UI / UX is your thing (or it's not and you want it to be) then I absolutely recommend DesignCourse. In addition to recommending the Net Ninja for general learning to program websites, I recommend design course for learning to make them look good.
- Recommended Video: [Give your flat designs depth](https://youtu.be/SJz2dKxvquE?si=LOQNetoAX2H8w3dM)

[Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship)

- About: Fireship frequently uploads fun, short, and informative videos on everything web dev. He's like your daily newspaper for web dev except it's fun and educational. Fireship is well known in the web dev community, and for good reason. Before you know it, it'll be your entire feed. You can get a high level overview of all sorts of programming and web news from him. He has some "100 seconds of" videos that deep dive in for another 10-15 mins with a speedy tutorial that are great.
- Recommended Video: [100+ computer science concepts](https://youtu.be/-uleG_Vecis?si=3RQpkvJXRAsR6Qsq)

[Joy of Code](https://www.youtube.com/@JoyofCodeDev)

- About: Joy of Code makes amazing quality videos largely around svelte and svelte kit. The videos are super well made, clean and easy to follow. He's my favorite guy for svelte content. He also has some non svelte videos, but svelte is definitely the majority.
- Recommended Video: [Svelte kit page transitions](https://youtu.be/gkw1wFIXM_8?si=ibrog5zGnJ2ZTluQ)

### General Programming

[Spanning Tree](https://www.youtube.com/@SpanningTree)

[Games Computers Play](https://www.youtube.com/@GamesComputersPlay)

- About: This could go in game dev, programming, or math, but I had to pick one category. Games computers play makes awesome videos on all sorts of games, programming a computer to (you guessed it) play that game, but it's so much more. The videos are short and sweet, but highly entertaining and educational. I recommend the minesweeper, tetris, and monopoly videos.
- Recommended Video: [Minesweeper oddities and their probabilities](https://youtu.be/YTnelZkjB68?si=ZdQH3M9SibHu2yi3)

Bonus mention of [AI solves 55 x 55 Rubiks Cube](https://youtu.be/f9smvQ5fc7Q?si=35R8GOq1KvVOWTt-) by [Code Bullet](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeBullet).

[The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain)

- About: This guy has been making fun and beginner friendly videos explaining important and complex topics for years. He loves to use p5 js which is a graphics library. He has a lot of videos and they're all great quality and very welcoming and useful. He started making videos on a whiteboard 8 years ago (which are still awesome videos) and has grown to a large audience. He's super friendly, and you can tell he loves what he does. It's like he's a guy on a TV show for toddlers, but he's teaching programming concepts in a fun and friendly way. Very likeable and approachable.
- Recommended Video: [Clock with p5.js](https://youtu.be/E4RyStef-gY?si=jqjpU0Jy4a_ibryN)

[Reducible](https://www.youtube.com/@Reducible)

- About: Reducible makes highly educational videos that are easy to follow on important programming topics that are necessary for the world to work. he's got videos on image compression, big o notation, graph theory, huffman codes, and more. He doesn't have many videos and posts are infrequent, but they're really amazing videos that I would absolutely recommend if you're interested.
- Recommended Video: [PNG compression](https://youtu.be/EFUYNoFRHQI?si=N1s-oiYuc_HTEJOM)

[Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia)

- About: Traversy Media makes very long videos that are "all in one" style, for those times you need to learn a language in one video and you already know how to program. You could also learn to program from Traversy Media, and he has some all in one videos on web development in 2023 (or x year) every year. He has mostly web videos, but he also has videos on plenty of other languages.
- Recommended Video: [HTML for beginners](https://youtu.be/UB1O30fR-EE?si=xZ2cIbmIz8lBEz57)

### Game Dev

[Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague)

- About: Sebastian makes absolutely amazing videos, usually using unity, explaining complex and cool topics about the real world and programming and modeling them. Check his how computers work videos, his chess videos, and his procedural planets. Amazing production quality and super calming and fun to watch, even if you don't think you're interested in the topic. I recommend his videos to every single person alive.
- Recommended Video: [Exploring how computers work](https://youtu.be/QZwneRb-zqA?si=WzyK_0Xeqhd8yU_o)

[BWDev](https://www.youtube.com/@BWDev/videos)

- About: Indie developer making an awesome factory builder called Lumbermill who posts infrequent dev logs. He's gone full time into this and is growing an audience. His videos are a lot of fun to watch and of all the dev logs I've seen for indie games, these are my far my favorite. Maybe these don't belong in the game dev category since you're not learning how to make a game and instead following a journey (but you still learn a little something about unity time to time). Videos are usually 10mins or less and you're always sad when they're over. Recommend to everyone.
- Recommended ~~Video~~ Playlist: [Lumbermill devlog playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kyBQFgfqJw&list=PLQrWgCpGF5B5e3btoq7nJj0bakRL1qcjD&ab_channel=BWDev)

### Math

[3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown)

- About: He explains complex math concepts in an interesting and simple way. He is "the" math guy as far as I'm concerned. You can be in highschool or college learning about math, just enjoy math in general, or need a specific video for something. Even if you don't enjoy math, you might want to check out one or two of his videos, and maybe that'll change your view on math as a whole; he's that good.
- Recommended Video: [Sliding blocks compute pi](https://youtu.be/jsYwFizhncE?si=a3jPHCP4ksD-UTcq)

[Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/@BenEater)

- About: Ben Eater makes amazing videos on electronics and computer architecture. He has a whole playlist on building a computer from scratch, and while it's fairly technical and long, these videos could easily replace multiple college courses, and they're way more educational, useful, and easier to follow. Ben is amazing at what he does. If you're not interested in how PCs work at a low level, probably not for you.

[Stuff made here](https://www.youtube.com/@StuffMadeHere)

- About: This is by far the best of the category. He creates insane engineering projects and documents the journey and it's super fun and crazy to watch, and educational as well. This is more in the "nerdy entertainment" category. He tests out wild things like a basketball hoop that cant miss or pool game where you cant miss, and made a tool to paint walls and a hair cutting machine. Crazy fun stuff. He's truly skilled and the videos are awesome to watch.
