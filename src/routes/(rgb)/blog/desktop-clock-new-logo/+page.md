### Desktop Clock's New Logo

### Out With the Old, in With the New

The old circle and line logo has been with Desktop Clock since first launch. It's by no means a bad logo, and it was both iconic and portrayed the design system of the old clock: a simple, plain analog clock.

It worked for the time, but we've since made quite a few changes to Desktop Clock. It's got a sleek new UI from the old version, has plenty of apps, and has a modern, glassmorphism look. it's time we got a real logo, and one that represents Desktop Clock, not just "a clock."

### Introducing Desktop Clock's First Logo Upgrade

We wanted to both pay homage to the old logo and still develop something fresh, new, beautiful, and something that feels Desktop Clock.

We've of course got the overlapping "D" and "C" for Desktop Clock here, as well as the half clock on the C. The opacity between letters helps break up the harsh colors, keep the letters readable, and add the glassy look we've got in our UI.

We hope you like our new logo as much as we do!
