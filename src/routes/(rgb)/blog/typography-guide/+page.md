### Overview

#### TL;DR

Use two fonts that contrast either font weight, serifs, or both. Chose a "boring" and readable font for your body copy and ensure your letter spacing, line height, and line length don't hinder readability.

#### Summary

This will be a crashcourse on the fundamentals of typography on the web, in print, and for your brand. There is an ever-evolving landscape of font families, styles, and choices in the modern era, and this guide will help you know what to look for and make the right choices, leaving your users happy and your message received.

#### Why You Care

Typography is two-fold: aesthetic and practical; an art form and a means to convey a message.

Good typography will:

- Allow readers to comfortably consume your message
- Increase accessibility on numerous devices and mediums for a wide audience
- Keep users around longer and keep them coming back
- Add a consistent branding and trustworthy name to your company

Bad typography will:

- Push would-be readers away
- Make it difficult for your message to translate between various screen sizes
- Prevent users from returning to your company or website
- Tarnish your brand

Just like a logo or a color palette, typography is an integral part of your brand.

### Basic Terminology

A **typeface** is a group of fonts that all have a consistent aesthetic. A **font** is a specific instance, for example, font weight (bold, semibold, thin) style (italicized), size (12pt, 16pt), and more (condensed, extended, small caps). A **letterform** is a single specific character in a font, for example, a lowercase "a."

### Font Classification

#### Serifs

**Serifs** are the small pointy bits at the end of a letter. They are generally used for body copy because they are more comfortable to read. Serifs originate from when chracters were created with a chisel on stone.

The two main categories of fonts are **serifs** and **sans serifs** ("sans" comes from French for "without," meaning without serifs).

<img src="/img/blog/posts/typography_serif_vs_sans.jpg" alt="serif vs sans serif">

<small>Image from <a href="https://www.canva.com/learn/serif-vs-sans-serif-fonts/" target="\_blank">canva</a></small>

#### Usages

A font is like a tool in a toolbelt. Not every tool is for every job. Just like you wouldn't hit a nail with a screwdriver, you wouldn't use comic sans for a wedding invitaion. But you could use it for an invite for a four year old's birthday.

Different fonts convey different messages.

Serifs are usually used in print, and are considered more traditional and formal. They improve readability in print. Sans serifs are cleaner and simpler, and the lack of serifs (especially before modern high density displays) make them easier to read on screens. They are considered modern and clean. Both serifs and sans serifs can make fine choices for many usages (but you'll have to get into more specifics to find the right one).

#### Other Classifications

Below you'll find a brief overview of some other classifications. We'll go into mroe detail later.

<img src="/img/blog/posts/typography_styles_of_fonts.jpg" alt="styles of fonts">

<small>Image from <a href="https://www.randallbranding.com/typowhat-the-ins-and-outs-of-typography/" target="\_blank">randall branding</a></small>

**Slab serifs** (or Egyptian fonts) feature serifs (and letterforms in general) that have very low or no stroke contrast (nearly uniform line width), often resembling sans serifs but with a uniform width line as a serif. They are usually either fairly bulky or fairly light. The bulkier ones are typically what one thinks of when they hear "slab serif" and are thought of as sturdy or hardy, possibly related to nature, earthy, and trustworthy. Thinner slab serifs are a trendy design and can, on the other hand, look modern and both quirky and aesthetically pleasing.

**Monospace** fonts have all characters the same width and are commonly used for programming or in tallying such as reciepts. They are also used for screenplays and provide the appearance of a typewriter. Unless you're going for a very specific and eye catching design, I would not use these unless it is absolutely necessary that all characters be the same width, such as for a programming enviornment.

**Display fonts** are for excessive or wild displays, not for body copy. For example, fatfaces, pixel fonts, stencil fonts, graffiti styles, or other fonts with quirks or focused more on attention than readability all fall under this broad category. These fonts are often experimental. These fonts are ok for use for headings, but only if you're careful. Something like a stencil font may look fun to you, but will likely ultimately look tacky and unprofessional.

**Script fonts** (or "cursive" or "handwriting" fonts) give the appearance of handwritten text. While stylistic, this is not very readable and often looks immature and is not practical. However, these fonts can be used for very small and specific typographic elements to convey a playful mood or something creative and hands-on. Sometimes, these fonts can make a good heading, such as a formal script being used for a beauty product or wedding invitation, but you want to tread carefully.

**Examples**

- Sans Serif: [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans)
- Serif: [Libre Baskerville](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville)
- Slab serif: [Crete Round](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Crete+Round)
- Display: [Audiowide](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Audiowide)
- Monospace: [Cutive Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cutive+Mono)
- Handwriting: [Indie Flower](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Indie+Flower)

These classifications cover the most generic ways to catalogue fonts, however, fonts are commonly categoried based on the ratios of specific characters, which are known as the font's proportions.

### Proportions

Preface: A large part of this section on proportions is based off of Karen Cheng's [Designing Type](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300249926/), an amazing book about everything that goes into the process of designing a typeface.

Proportions are the building blocks of typography, and dictate a lot of the details in a fontface.

Proportions dictate the width relative to the height of each letterform in a fontface.

> The ratios between x-height, capital height, and overall height, the position of the baseline and x-height within the total height, the average width for all signs (normal, condensed, wide), and rthe relative widths of individual characters (l,n,m)

â€” Karen Cheng in page 64 of [Designing Type](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300249926/)

<img src="/img/blog/posts/typography_proportions.jpg" alt="font proportions">

<small>Classical and 'Modern' letter proportions (adapted from (Cheng, 2006)). The typeface 'Trajan' by Carol Twombly (up) and the typeface 'Neoplanta BG' by Stjepan Fileki (down). Image from <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Classical-and-Modern-letter-proportions-adapted-from-Cheng-2006-The-typeface_fig2_347649220" target="\_blank">ResearchGate</a></small>

#### Classic Proportions

Classic or old style proportions (also sometimes called roman proportions) are modeled after ancient Roman engravings and other ancient inscribtional models. These proportions are considered to be elegant and have a large distinctions between letterforms. This was the first commonly used proportion system.

To quote once more from Cheng:

> - M, O, Q are square
> - L, K, S, X are half-square width
> - B, E, F, I, J, P are the width of a root five rectangle
> - A, H, R, T, U, Y, Z fit within two stacked golden rectangles
> - C, D, G, N, V are the width of two root five rectangles
> - W fits within a square with a root five rectangle

These proportions are applied to the capital letters. Some fontfaces claim to have classic proportions, but do not completely adhere to this system. These capitals, while beautiful and profound, are often less practical as they take up a lot of space. Additionally, this proportion system produces capitals with uneven color (amount of black and whtie space on page in different areas).

#### Modern Proportions

Modern proportions, on the other hand, have a much more even color, and are therefore suited better for body copy. Text with even color can reduce reader fatigue and increase the overall aesthetic of the typography.

#### Which Classifications Have Which Proportions

Serif capitals can have either set of proportions.

Humanist sans serifs often have classic proportions, and modern fonts and slab serif fonts almost always have modern proportions. Grotesque and Neo-grotesque fonts usually have modern proportions as well; The modernist movement was aimed towards simplicity and objectivity, so modern proportions are naturally best fit for these goals.

Geometric sans serifs are almost always based off of perfect or near perfect circles and squares when possible.

### Classifications

<img src="/img/blog/posts/typography_old_style.jpg" alt="old style typefaces">

<img src="/img/blog/posts/typography_humanist.jpg" alt="humanist typefaces">

#### Old Style and Humanist

Old Style and Humanist fonts mimic the stroke of a pen, with proportions similar to traditional Roman lettering. Old Style fonts are serifs and have a traditional and fancy heir to them. However, Humanist fonts are sans serifs, which borrow from Roman proportions (same as Old Style). These fonts often have a diagonal stress (rather than vertical) which emulates caligraphy, a low contrast, and serifs with prominent brackets. Usually, these fonts have a tall x-height. Despite being sans serifs, Humanist fonts still clearly have a caligraphic influence. Humanist fonts have more contrast than most sans serifs, and feature wide apertures as well.

Example: [Goudy Bookletter 1911](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Goudy+Bookletter+1911) (serif) [Merriweather Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather+Sans) (sans serif)

History: Old style was developed between the 15th and 18th centuries for metal type. These fonts fell out of favor in the 18th and 19th centirues, but saw more use in the 20th century (as many fonts have) and are still popular now. Humanist fonts are sans serifs and therefore newer than old style fonts.

Usage: These fonts can be used all around. They have an elegance associated with them. Consider using something else for highly modern marketing or branding.

<img src="/img/blog/posts/typography_transitional.jpg" alt="transitional typefaces">

#### Transitional / Neo-classical

Traditional, or "neo-classical" fontfaces resemble penship (similar to Old Style fontfaces), however, they also feature more symmetry and uniformity, have a higher contrast, and have more structure. These fonts are often serifs and usually have a vertical stress. Letterforms usually have a high contrast, and these fontfaces also often have tall x-heights.

Example: [Baskervville](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Baskervville)

History: First appearing in the late 18th century, these fonts have been revived often in the past couple centuries. As printed processes were refined, fonts with finer details were created (hence sharper serifs on these fonts)

Usage: These fonts can be used all around. They have some of the elegance from humanist fonts with a refined look.

<img src="/img/blog/posts/typography_modern.jpg" alt="modern typefaces">

#### Modern

Modern fonts (sometimes called Didone fonts) have straight, flat serifs, with very small or no brackets, vertical stress, and rounded terminals. These fonts have a very large contrast and tall x-height.

Example: [Bodoni Moda](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bodoni+Moda)

History: Began in the late 18th and early 19th century.

Usage: Modern fonts give a very "designer" feel and make for great headlines in my opinion. They are commonly used in fashion, beauty, and for magazine covers or article headlines.

<img src="/img/blog/posts/typography_slab_serif.jpg" alt="slab serif typefaces">

#### Slab Serifs

Slab serifs are uniquely defined by square, often heavy serifs. Often, slab serifs have no bracket to connect the serifs to the strokes. They have a uniform stroke and a fully vertical stress. Slab serifs often have a tall x-height.

Example: [Zilla Slab](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Zilla+Slab)

History: Slab serifs first started appearing around the early 18th century.

Usage: Slab serifs are traditionally very bulky and industrial, but some of them have been developed with thinner font weights which can, in contrast to their predecessors, convey elegance and a modern design if used correctly. Generally, one would not want to chose slab serifs for body copy, but if you do, chose a font that is highly readable and has a thin font weight. You'll see slab serifs used for industrial settings, for goods and services relating to nature, or maybe for a barbeque restaurant. Thin slab serifs can be used similarly to other trendy and modern fonts. Once you've found an appropriate usage, they make great headings.

<img src="/img/blog/posts/typography_grotesque.jpg" alt="grotesque typefaces">

<img src="/img/blog/posts/typography_neo_grotesque.jpg" alt="neo grotesque typefaces">

#### Grotesque / Neo-grotesque

Grotesque and Neo-grotesque typefaces have an aesthetic considered irregular and unusual at the time and were the first sans serifs, hence the name, "grotesque." Despite the name, there are many great Grotesque and Neo-grotesque typefaces. These fonts are sans serifs and usually have a small contrast and the same cap height and ascender height. Neo-grotesque fonts came later and evolved minimal and simple letterforms with uniform strokes and straight terminals. Notably, Grotesque fonts have a "double story" lowercase "g" and Neo-grotesque fonts have a "single story" lowercase "g." Neo-grotesque fonts also have tight apertures (notable, lowercase "a" and "e"), which may hinder readability, while Grotesque fonts have open apertures. However, Neo-grotesque fonts are otherwise considered more readable, and were developed later in the 20th century in order to be neutral and legible, therefore a lot of the "personality" of Grotesque fonts were removed.

Example: [Work Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) (grotesque) [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) (grotesque)

History: These fonts were seen in the early 20th century and were refined into neo-grotesque in in the mid 20th century.

Usage: These fonts can be used all around. Grotesque fonts stand out more, while Neo-grotesque fonts don't stand out as much and work well for neutral body copy.

<img src="/img/blog/posts/typography_geometric.jpg" alt="geometric typefaces">

#### Geometric

Geometric typefaces are sans serifs and constructed from geometric shapes such as straight lines and circles. These fonts have uniform stroke thickness. Part of being geometric means rectangular letterforms and optically circular bowls.

Example: [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins)

History: Geometric typefaces were popular in the early 20th century and late 20th century. They were likely created earlier.

Usage: These typefaces are less ideal for body copy as repeating shapes and patterns decrease readability. However, a notable exception is Futura, which was designed to be practical and is widely used in body copy despite being a geometric typeface.

<img src="/img/blog/posts/typography_formal_script.jpg" alt="formal script typefaces">

<img src="/img/blog/posts/typography_casual_script.jpg" alt="casual script typefaces">

<img src="/img/blog/posts/typography_caligraphic.jpg" alt="caligraphic typefaces">

<img src="/img/blog/posts/typography_handwritten.jpg" alt="handwritten typefaces">

#### Scripts

Script fonts are based on cursive handwriting, and divided into several categories. Formal scripts are more elegant, connected, and have fancy swashes and flourishes. Casual scripts mimic a wet brush and may or may not have connected letterforms. Caligraphic fonts are often not considered a script font, mimic caligraphy (of course) and have letterforms that emulate brush strokes, with high contrast. Handwriten fonts are also often not categoried with scripts, and have a very casual look and feel, and lack a rigid structure that other fonts have, in order to mimic handwriting.

Example: [Dancing Script](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dancing+Script)

History: These fonts each have vastly different histories, but it's easy to tell how they were inspired. Formal script and caligraphic fonts came first.

Usage: Scripts are not suitable for body copy. Formal scripts can make nice headings for the right job (maybe a beauty product or a wedding invitation), but I would refrain from using other scripts or caligraphic fonts for anything except watermarks and little designs on packages, etc.

#### A Note on Fontface Usage Regarding Classifications

Different font classifications often reflect their time period. The same way that it would be bizarre to bring a lego set to a football game, it would prompt similar quizical expressions if you were to use a modern font for a company doing 18th century photography, or if you were to use an old style font for a modern fashion brand. It's important to be mindful of the historical period a classification (not the font itself) comes from when using it for a specific use case.

#### More Notes on Usage

Different fonts communicate different feelings thought design. You'll want to chose a font based on the look and feel, branding, and emotion you want to convey.

Serifs often evoke an older, formal look and feel, and are great for body copy, specifically in print. Sans serif letterforms are clean and modern, and can also be used for both body and heading copy. Sans serifs work well on the web and for screens. Both serifs and sans serifs will still work well on either medium and for headings or body copy. Scripts should be mostly limited to wedding invitations, book covers, and specific historical displays when appropriate. Caligraphic fonts can convey a personal look and feel, but should be used with caution.

### Letterforms

A **letterform** is a specific character and its shape, in context of a specific typeface or font. A **glyph** is a representation of a character, commonly used un context of a collection of glyphs. A single character can have multiple glyphs, for example, multiple glyphs for the character "a" or "1."

There are numerous terms used to describe letterforms, but we'll go over only some of the basics here.

<img src="/img/blog/posts/typography_anatomy.png" alt="typography anatomy">

<small>Image from <a href="https://m2.material.io/design/typography/understanding-typography.html#type-properties" target="\_blank">material.io</a></small>

#### Important Lines

The **baseline** is the line that all characters sit on. Note that descenders can go below this.

The **x-height** is traditionally the height of a lowercase "x" and is often a marker for the height of lowercase letters. This is very important for legibility.

The **cap height** is the height of a capital letter.

**Ascenders** and **descenders** go above the x-height (and usually above the cap height) and below the baseline respectively. Lowercase "b" and "d" typically have ascenders and lowercase "g" and "p" are good examples of letterforms with descenders.

Quick take away: x-height is typically used as a measure of readability and aesthetic (well specifically relative to the cap height). Other lines are generally relative to the ratio between the x-height and cap height. Often when referring to "x-height," people mean the ratio between the x-height and the cap height.

#### Font Variants

<img src="/img/blog/posts/typography_font_variants.jpg" alt="font variants">

<small>Image from <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/typography-terms-ux/" target="\_blank">nngroup</a></small>

**Font weight** refers to how thick the typeface's stroke is in general. Often, fonts use a scale between 100 and 900 in incremenets of 100 where the larger number coresponds to a larger font weight. Most typefaces have a small number (sometimes just one or two) hand crafted font weights, with some professional typefaces featuring seven to nine. **Variable font weights** are a recent development that allow the end user to fully customize the font weight. (Website performance note: each additional font weight will significantly impact performance).

**Common font weight names:**

- 100 - ultra light, extra light, or thin
- 200 - ultra light, extra light, or thin
- 300 - light
- 400 - regular, or normal
- 500 - medium, or book
- 600 - semibold or bold
- 700 - bold or heavy
- 800 - extra bold or black
- 900 - extra black or black

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-weight) has some reasonable font weight names if you're looking for a standard.

**Font width** refers to how "streched out" the letterforms are. Generally, you want to avoid using other widths unless it's for stylistic effect, for a heading for example. Normal width is best for body copy.

**Common width / proportion names:**

- extra condensed / extra compressed
- condensed / compressed
- semi condensed / semi compressed / narrow
- regular
- wide
- expanded / extended

#### Parts of a Letterform

**Contrast** refers to the difference between the thick and thin parts of the stroke in a letterform. Monolinear types such as slab serifs have very low stroke contrast, whereas fatface fonts (such as [Abril Fatface](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Abril+Fatface)) have greater contrast.

<img src="/img/blog/posts/typography_font_stress.jpg" alt="font stress">

<small>Image from <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-vertical-stress-in-typography" target="\_blank">quora</a></small>

The **stress** of a letterform refers to where the stroke width changes on the letterform.

<img src="/img/blog/posts/typography_letterform_anatomy.jpg" alt="letterform anatomy">

<small>Image from <a href="https://designmodo.com/letterform/" target="\_blank">design modo</a></small>

The **terminal** is the ending of a stroke. This is relevant because many letterforms will have stylistic terminals that can be curved or balled that change the perception of a font both in aesthetic and in legibility.

The **ink trap** refers to the negative space (or lack thereof) inside of a letterform that would traditionally be used to trap ink when printed (or stamped), but is now (as many other aspects of typography) an artifact of older technologies that remains popular for stylistic reasons.

The **aperture** is the opening, notably in lowercase "a" and "e" which has a sizeable impact on both aesthetic and readability.

The **bowl** is the stroke around a curve in a letterform, such as in the "o" or "a."

There are many, many other parts of a letterform, the **crossbar** (horizontal line within as seen in "A" or "H"), the **stem** (vertical stroke as seen in "I", "H", "W"), but I'll be keeping this section brief.

### Typesetting

(Typography and Copy)

**Legibility**

The measure of how easy text is to read, depends on ability to distinguish between characters, view characters together, and read a line or block of text.

To chose a legible font, consider the x height, chose a normal character width (not condensed or extended) and weight (not light or bold). "Book" or "Regular" weight is best. Neutral fonts (fonts with less personality) are the most readable. High contrast fonts can result in decreased legibility due to having very thin strokes (especially Modern fonts). Legibility is far more important for body text than headings, as headings will be very large and readers will be drawn to them, but body text will be small and where the user spends most of their time.

Avoid all caps fonts for legibility. Note that ascenders and descenders help distinguish characters.

#### Body and Heading Copy

Body copy refers to the paragraphs and most basic and smallest copy on your page.

Headings are the most important copy and are generally larger and more important.

Subheadings are generally used to divide subsections, but can be used anywhere you want to distinguish that this text is important, but is not as important as a heading.

#### Spacing

kerning, tracking, leading, measure/line length

many of these features heavily impact readability (as well as font weight and color)

#### Typography on the Page

This section will be about applying typography to your design.

**Hierarchy**

Hierarchy is one of the most important parts of the layout of your typography. As with any other aspect of design, typography also requires an understanding of the fundamental design principals. Visual hierarchy is the notion that some elements are more important than others, and the general flow you want users to consume your information.

In context of typography, it's the order of the type in your document. The user should be able to quickly discern between headers, subheaders, and body copy. Additionally, you want a consistent aesthetic, for the experience of your readers, and for your brand.

alignment and justification

filler text

rhythm

widows and orphans

**Type Scale**

https://type-scale.com/ blah blah multiply by numbers, round to even numbers, pixels, em, rem, ch units on web
multiply by a number, third, fourth, golden ratio
can use tailwind's numbers, use units on your grid such as 0.25rem (4px)

### Chosing fonts

#### What to Look for When Choosing a Typeface

Before you can chose a font pair, you must understand the individual font. There are two key considerations for chosing a font: readability, and aesthetic.

For legibility, you should only use "boring" looking serif or sans serifs for your body copy that are easily readable and have good kerning and x heights, and letterforms that can be distingusihed.

The style or mood conveyed by your font is also a huge consideration. It depends on the appearance you are trying to present. If you are an old bank, newspaper, or possibly b2b establishment, you would likely want to chose a serif font, to provide an established and trusthworthy appearance. However, if you're a new starup, techy or trendy, or it is otherwise important that you look sleek, modern, and up to date, you likely want a sans serif that looks modern, clean, and minimal. There are of course many other considerations such as classification and proportions that can be delved into further, however, this is just a brief overview of the perception garnered by these generic categories. Slab serifs are earthy or industrial, however, lighter weight ones can also look modern and clean. There are plenty of exceptions to most rules, however, it's important to know the rules before you break them; otherwise, you pages and brand will look out of place, inexperienced, or otherwise inappropriate.

#### Font Pairs

My first generic advice is simple: pair a serif and a sans serif. You can also choose two sans serifs, and I would recommend doing so if you're trying to go with a very clean and minimal aesthetic. I would **not** pair two serifs, as it is cluttered and they often do not provide sufficient contrast, or if they do, they look inconsistent with each other. Pairing a serif and sans serif, generally, the serif is used for body copy, however, I personally really enjoy a clean sans serif as a readable body copy, and a fancy and eloquent serif for headings and titles.

Pairing fonts presents an itneresting conundrum: you want your fonts to look distinct and contrast each other (in my opinion, a **lot**), however, you also want them to look like they **belong**. This leads to my first few tips:

Chose fonts with similar x heights and proportions. This means the fonts look like they belong together, and they can stil contrast each other in other ways.

Chose fonts that contrast each other significantly in either serif (sans serif and serif, slab serif and sans serif, etc) or font weight (very bold headings and light body copy, or more dense body copy and a hairline heading). However, you should avoid picking a font weight too large for your body copy, as it can greatly impair readability and just make your color look worse.

One simple tip is to just use one fontface. You heard me right. First I say you want similar fonts, then different ones, and now I say you only need one? Let me explain: using one fontface ensures the text is consistent in nearly every measure: x height and color, proportions, overall style, and you have a consistent image. However, you can still have a lot of contrast by chosing different sizes, weights, and even other variants such as a condensed or extended version of a font. You could use a small caps version for a subheading or another piece of information such as author or date on a card, or label on a form. Additionally, some popular fontfaces feature a number of variants that maintain a consistent look, but use competely different categories. Roboto has a serif, a sans serif, and even a slab serif. Hell, there's a monospaced version too! [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/?query=roboto)

Use at most two fonts. Only when you've truly mastered typography, and you have a very good reason, should you use more than two fonts. Even three fonts makes for a very wild experience, and you have to understand how all fonts interact with each other and what message you're conveying. If you were to use three fonts, you would have one for body copy, one for headers, and one uniquely for your brand, for example, if your logo is a letterform or contains a lot of type.

Only use script fonts for headers, not body copy. The more "boring" the more readable is generally true. Here's a word of wisdom from yours truly: good typography is like good makeup, or good mayonaise: you don't even notice it's there unless you're looking for it, but you're much better off with it than without it. Generally, when someone notices typography (unless they're a type nerd like you are starting to become in reading this), it's because they found something bad, not good. Leave your crazy design decisions and creative whims for the headings, and keep the body copy simple. Not only will it be more readable, but it will further emphasize your headings. Even if you chose a rather bland heading, if you chose an even more basic body typeface, then the heading will still shine.

Use a complex and sophisticated (but still highly readable) font for your body copy, and a big bold (or semibold) sans serif for your headings. The contrast will be beautiful. Or, do the inverse, but don't make your body text too dark.

Italicize your subheaders, and don't italicize anything else. This makes it distinct from the body copy and the headers at a glance. Visual hierarchy, ya know?

**Specific Fonts**

It's often best to go with one or two of the all time classic fonts. Classic doesn't mean that it's too old or our of style. These fonts are time tested, readable, reliable, and still aesthetic, and a popular choice for many. Even type pros who sift through thousands of fonts and studied for years, and big businesses that can commission their own fonts on a whim will still often use fonts like Helvetica, Garamond, or Futura. Check out [this article on 25 classic fonts](https://blog.spoongraphics.co.uk/articles/25-classic-fonts-that-will-last-a-whole-design-career) as a reference.

**Forget 25; six fonts should suffice!**

Famous Italiain designer Massimo Vignelli famously said "the only 6 typefaces you'll ever need" when referring to:

- Bodoni
- Century Expanded
- Futura
- Garamond

### Performance

**Font Files**

- Postscript (.ps) - developed by Adobe in the 1980s. Separate files needed for different operating systems, as well as for print and render, which became problematic. Holds about 220 glyphs.
- TrueType (.ttf) - developed jointly by Apple and Microsoft in the early 1990s. Files could hold print and screen data and 65 thousand glyphs.
- OpenType (.otf) - developed in the late 1990s. Uses unicode to allow up to 65 thousand glpyhs and multiple languages. Cross-platform.
- Scalable Vector Graphics (.svg) - Usually SVGs are used for logos and icons online, but they can also be used for fonts. These were derived from OpenType. Characters can be displayd in various colors and animated due to being simple SVG files at their core.
- Variable Fonts (.vf) - developed jointly by Adobe, Apple, Google, and Microsoft in 2016. Technically known as "OpenType Font Variations" and allows for up to 65 thousand unique glyph sets which can vary in font weight width, and slant. This means these files can be nearly fully customized by the end user, rather than being restricted to a few font weights.

### Web Tips

Now that you've got your fonts selected and performant, and know all about the basics of typography, what tips and tricks can we use to best organize and layout this type on the web?

line heights between 1.2 and 1.5

font size in rem, default 1rem (16px) scales with user device

containers mean consistent width, so no orphans and a few static layouts rather than being different by every pixel a user device is

organizing with tpypography css file use type scale, lay out line heights, top and bottom margins in advance

don't change character spacing of font, if badly kerned use a better font, changing will be like doodling on mona lisa with crayon, these values fine tuned after dozens, sometimes hudnreds of hours

absolutely do not use stroke to make a font "bolder"

variable fonts are your friend for many stroke widths, but still come at file size cost

important: don't go overboard with many different font sizes, weights, styles, etc. even two fontfaces can be too many and overwhelming if you have many many different combinations of font size, weight, etc. develop six or seven styles for headings (3-4), body (1) small (1) links (1) and use consistent system everywhere. typography is a SYSTEM in your design, just like a color palette. need to be consistent and will look best and establish brand and comfort

45-90 chars per line. containers containers containers. tailwind has `max-w-prose` class at 65ch max width

remember: right tool for the job

layouts and numbers, quick reference:
sizing: 15-25px (screen. print would be 10-12pt) (fonts with larger x-height are easier to read on smaller sizes)

**Tracking**
Letter spacing. Try not to change this, unless absolutely necessary, or stylistically for a heading.

**Leading**
Line height. 120% to 150% of text size (changes based off of text size and x height)

**Line Length / Column Width**
45-90 (ideally 60-70) chracters per line

primary heading 175%-200% of body text, secondary heading 125-150% of body text size
alignment: generally, avoid temptation of aligning text to center
line height, tailwind example use line height number not units, relative to font size, link to tailwind defaults text-xl, text-lg, etc
