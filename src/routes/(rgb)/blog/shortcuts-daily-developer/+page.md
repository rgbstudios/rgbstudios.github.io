Some of these are simple, and some more complex. I'm listing all of the shortcuts I use multiple times a day, so bare with me:

### VS Code

- `Ctrl F` - Find (`alt enter` after searching in VS Code to add a cursor to each location)
- `Alt click` - Multi cursor in VS Code
- `Ctrl D` - Select the next instance of highlighted text (hit a few times to keep selecting more text)
- `Ctrl L` - Select line
- `Ctrl X, Ctrl C, Ctrl V` - Cut, Copy, Paste (in VS Code, if you select nothing, it cuts/copies the line)
- `Double click` - select word
- `Triple click` - Select line
- `Quad click` - Select all (also `Ctrl A`)
- `Ctrl Shift F` - Find in all files (`Ctrl Shift E` is files and `Ctrl Shift G` is git)
- `Ctrl P` - Type file name to open
- `Alt Z` - Toggle line wrap
- `Alt Arrows` - Move selected lines up/down, or change files left/right (can select multiple lines to move)
- `Ctrl \` - Split editor
- `Ctrl Shift V` - Preview Markdown
- `Ctrl W` - Close tab window (currently open file) (works in browser to close current tab)
- `Ctrl Tab` and `Ctrl Shift Tab` - Change tabs (works in browser)
- `Ctrl Enter` - Insert newline below (even if your cursor is in the middle of a line) (`Ctrl Shift Enter` for new line above)
- `Ctrl Arrows` - Move left/right one word at a time
- `Shift Arrows` - Select left/right characters (or lines with up and down arrows)
- `Ctrl Shift Arrows` - Select left/right word at a time
- `Ctrl Backspace` / `Ctrl Delete` - Delete previous word / next word
- `Home` / `End` - Start or end of line
- `Ctrl Home` / `Ctrl End` - Move to start or end of file
- `Ctrl Alt Arrows (up/down)` - Make new cursors above/below
- `Ctrl 1` - Focus editor (this might feel dumb when you can just click, but preventing yourself from needing the mouse is great)
- Right click file tab, then `Shift Alt R` - Reveal in file explorer

I also recommend a plugin to quickly change quotes, and a plugin called "Auto Rename Tag" which will rename the other corresponding XML/HTML tag when you rename one (super useful!)

VS Code has [Emmet](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/emmet) built in, and while I won't explain in detail here, you can use things like `p.hello` to make a new paragraph of class hello: `<p class="hello"></p>` and you can chain classes and use IDs: `div#hello.there.world`: `<div id="hello" class="there world"></div>` and make multiple elements with `*` and use tab to change what part you're filling out. For example: `ul>li*4` works as you'd expect and makes a `<ul>` with 4 `<li>` inside it, and you can hit tab and fill each out.

### Windows

- `Win V` - Clipboard manager - has a history of items you've copied
- `Win Shift S` - Screenshot tool - copy a portion of the screen or the whole screen to clipboard
- `Alt Tab` - Change tabs
- `Win Tab` - Show all tabs then can change tabs
- `Win (number)` - Open that number app on taskbar, for example, if chrome is item 2 in taskbar, use `Win 2`
- `Win L` - Lock the PC
- `Win X -> U -> (S, U, or R)` (sleep, shut down, or restart)
  - `Win X` then `U` then `S` to sleep
  - `Win X` then `U` then `U` to shut down
  - `Win X` then `U` then `R` to restart
- `Win .` - Win and period to open the emoji picker, just type and then use arrow keys and hit enter
- `F2` - Rename selected file
- `Ctrl L` - Highlight file explorer location (works in browser to highlight address bar)

I use Power Toys for fancy zones, which allows me to drag a window holding `Shift` to drop it into a specific zone or holding `Ctrl Shift` to make it take up multiple zones. [Power Toys](https://aka.ms/installpowertoys) has lots of other awesome tools and I highly recommend it. It makes Windows just a little less worse : )

### GitHub Desktop

- `Ctrl Shift A` - Open in VS Code (or whatever editor you have setup in Github Desktop)
- `Ctrl Shift G` - Open on Github.com
- `Ctrl Shift F` - Open in File Explorer
- `Ctrl B` - Change branches
- `Ctrl P` - Push
- `Ctrl Shift P` - Pull
- `Ctrl Shift T` - Fetch
- `Ctrl Shift N` - New branch
- `Ctrl Alt P` - Preview pull request

### Email

- `Ctrl K` - Select a link then hit `ctrl K` to turn it into a clickable link in gmail and some other email clients
