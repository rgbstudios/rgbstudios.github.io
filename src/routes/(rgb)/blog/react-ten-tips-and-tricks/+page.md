ReactJS is the most widely used JavaScript library for app development. This robust framework allows developers to create fully responsive web applications.

ReactJS developers are in high demand for a variety of web applications. In this blog post, we will explore some essential skills needed to excel as a React developer.

## About ReactJS

With the help of a component-based design process, the JavaScript framework ReactJS creates declarative interfaces.

React's main goals are to be simple, fast, declarative, and adaptable. It can be used to control the view layers of both mobile and web apps.

Users can design reusable components that demonstrate changing data throughout time. Among the various open-source frameworks available for building front-end apps, ReactJS stands out for its exceptional features.

## Ten Tips to Become a Better ReactJS Developer

### 1. Avoid Re-rendering

Re-rendering should never be used to increase the speed of your app. It is desirable to minimize the number of re-renderings by moving data down the component tree instead of employing state or context modifications.

Imagine the following scenario: Your app has a section where users' usernames and descriptions of their responsibilities are listed. You must run code to get the list of administrators for all users. Instead of having code repeatedly run to retrieve the results, you should cache calls and obtain data based on your current needs. The workload on the system will be significantly decreased, and its performance will be enhanced.

## 2. Use Pure Components

Use pure components rather than class components to save rendering overhead and boost efficiency. Pure components automatically implement the ShouldComponentUpdate function, which uses a cursory comparison of props and states to decide whether or not the component should update.

## 3. Use Virtualization

Virtualization is one of the best methods that ReactJS development companies may employ to enhance app performance.

Performance problems typically occur in many apps with extensive lists of DOM elements. This happens because the complete list is rendered in the DOM, which eventually results in a slow UI and poor app performance. However, this issue is eliminated by virtualizing larger lists and grids. Only the restricted list of visible elements is presented on the DOM rather than the lengthy list of all components to be rendered on the app screen.

## 4. Use the Right Keys

To avoid re-rendering the complete list, utilize stable and unique keys when rendering lists in React apps. Always use a different key prop for each item when rendering lists in React. This is advantageous because doing so makes it easier for React to determine which components need to be updated.

## 5. Use `ShouldComponentUpdate`

It is generally acknowledged that most performance problems in mobile apps can be fixed with just a few modest adjustments that can significantly speed up your app.

The `ShouldComponentUpdate` method in React is one such feature. It is a React lifecycle hook that prevents any given component from being rendered again if its state stays the same.

To optimize when components render based on the values of their props and state, implement the `ShouldComponentUpdate` lifecycle function.

## 6. Use Immutable Data Structures

React's most robust feature is the fact that it uses immutable data structures. For React developers, it is simpler to implement immutable data structures like seamless-immutable or Immutable.js to guarantee that the data does not change suddenly and cause unnecessary renderings.

## 7. Use React Developer tools

Utilize the [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi) browser extension to examine the performance of your application and find areas for improvement. This aids in not just identifying weaknesses but also correcting errors and getting rid of bugs to improve performance.

It is best to leave this in the hands of professionals for excellent results. [Hire Dedicated ReactJS developers](https://www.esparkinfo.com/hire-reactjs-developers.html?utm_source=rgbstudios) to optimize the speed of your projects using React Developer Tools.

## 8. Use Error Boundaries

Although errors are frequent, they shouldn't cause your program to crash if they display in view. To handle this, [Error Boundaries](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html#introducing-error-boundaries) have been added to React. These are wrapped around other components. They will then identify lifecycle method issues when rendering. The `componentDidCatch` function can reply to the error and offer a fallback or log it.

## 9. Use the Latest Version of React

To ensure optimal functionality and performance of your ReactJS applications, it's best to utilize the latest versions available. New versions often include bug fixes and performance upgrades that can significantly enhance your app's performance.

To keep up with the demands of modern web development and ensure that your app is equipped with the latest features and capabilities, it's crucial that you utilize the most recent version of React.

## 10. Use Hooks

React hooks were initially made available to developers with React 16.8. Hooks are features that allow functions to “hook into” state and other React features.

State and lifecycle processes are contained in relatively lightweight functional components, previously only permitted in the relatively heavy-weight class components.

In addition to the built-in hooks supplied by React, developers can create custom hooks to meet their specific needs.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, ReactJS is a powerful tool for building web applications. By becoming familiar with these tips and tricks, you will enhance and streamline your React coding skills and become a more efficient developer.

After mastering these techniques, you can develop plugins, applications, and extensions more quickly and effectively.

Mastering ReactJS can elevate your development skills and help you produce higher quality websites and apps and make landing a web development role easier.
